# TheElementBendingGame
Working towards a 3D game based on the Avatar tv shows build only with JS, html, and css for now (most cross platform). 
  
## How to Play:
Press the 'd' key to hold the objects of different masses steady.  
Press the 'e' key to try and accelerate the objects up and away!  
Press the 'f' key to hurl an object to the ground!  
Press any of the '1', '2', ... or '9' keys to change the percent amount of mass you're willing to support, with '1' being 10% of your max, '9' being 90%, and '0' resets to the max limit of 100%.
  
## How to Play on your Web Browser:  
Either go to the following site for the previous edition: https://irelandlife.github.io/myAvatarGame.html  
Or, download the index.html file, and open it with your web browser.  
Press the "Start Game" button towards the bottom of the screen.  
Use your computer keys (for now) to control the objects.  
Reload the page, exit out of the window, or press your back button after you're done playing since it refreshes all the objects on the page at 50FPS.
