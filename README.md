# TheElementBendingGame
Working towards a 3D game based on the Avatar tv shows build only with JS, html, and css for now (most cross platform). 
  
# How to Play:
Press the 'd' key to hold the objects of different masses steady.  
Press the 'e' key to try and accelerate the objects up and away!  
Press the 'f' key to hurl an object to the ground!  
Press any of the '1', '2', ... or '9' keys to change the percent amount of mass you're willing to support, with '1' being 10% of your max, '9' being 90%, and '0' resets to max limit.
